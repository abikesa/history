1. hierarchy

Yes, I'm familiar with the scene from "The Devil Wears Prada" where Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, explains to Andy Sachs, played by Anne Hathaway, the depth and influence of the fashion industry. In this scene, Miranda elucidates the chain of decisions and influences that led to Andy's choice of a blue sweater, detailing how even what Andy considers to be a mundane piece of clothing has been shaped by the high-fashion world. This monologue reflects the hierarchical nature of fashion and Miranda's top-tier position within that hierarchy. It's a critical moment that underscores the power dynamics and complexities of taste, choice, and influence within the fashion industry.
