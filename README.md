"Critique of 'The Devil Wears Prada' through the Lens of Nietzsche's 'On the Uses and Abuses of History for Life'"

In Friedrich Nietzsche’s essay "On the Uses and Abuses of History for Life," he outlines three types of history: monumental, antiquarian, and critical. When examining "The Devil Wears Prada" through this triadic structure, one can interpret the film as a narrative interplay of these historical senses, particularly emphasizing an antiquarian reverence for the character of Miranda Priestly.

The monumental aspect of history is evident in the fashion industry's celebration of great designers and trendsetters. Miranda Priestly, as the editor-in-chief of a leading fashion magazine, is portrayed as a monumental figure whose achievements inspire and intimidate. This aligns with Nietzsche's idea of monumental history, which venerates great individuals and their legacies, potentially igniting the ambition of future generations.

In an antiquarian sense, the film reveres the established traditions and practices of the fashion world. Miranda’s authority is grounded in her extensive knowledge and maintenance of the industry's historical excellence. Nietzsche might criticize this reverence as potentially stifling innovation since an `overemphasis` on tradition can lead to a lack of critical questioning and creative advancement.

From the perspective of critical history, the film invites viewers to question the value systems within the fashion industry. Andy Sachs, the protagonist, initially succumbs to the allure of Miranda’s world but ultimately critiques and rejects its superficial value system. Nietzsche would likely see Andy's journey as necessary for personal growth, as she employs a critical historical perspective to assess and eventually overcome the oppressive elements of her environment.

In the context of Nietzsche’s framework, the film’s treatment of Miranda Priestly with reverence could be seen as an antiquarian approach, one that respects and preserves the status quo without necessarily advancing it. While the film does not overtly engage with Nietzschean philosophy, its narrative can be dissected using his conceptualization of history, offering a richer understanding of its themes regarding the tension between the preservation of tradition and the necessity of individual growth and innovation.
