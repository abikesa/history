- Monumental
   - Bach, blues guitarist Robert Johnson, and ragtime composer Scott Joplin are `scandals` in their own time, but `legends` at a to-be-determined later date when their legacy can be `appropriated` by a sanctioned narrative.
- Antiquarian
   - When the `mythos` of Bach’s genius finally emerged, it coincided with a rising sense of German nationalism and a religious revival, movements that envisioned ways they could use this now long-dead composer to advance its own agendas. It’s not even clear that Bach self-identified as a German—rather than as a Saxon or Thuringian. Yet by 1802 his biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel could proudly proclaim: “This man, the `greatest` musical poet and the greatest music orator that ever existed, and probably ever will exist, was a German. Let his country be proud of him.”

   - This is the familiar recurring cycle in the history of `subversive` music.  The role of the music `historian` is to bring this rehabilitative process into the open, but for some it is all too tempting—perhaps even irresistible—to participate in turning the life story of a troublemaking `provocateur` into a `monument` to the new status quo.

               - Every ear, brain, little finger, hands, foot, vocal chord, breathing cadence, is channeling the spirit of Bach
               - So did my feet & ankles (and of course more) on my record-breaking trot (1501 calories/9.3MI) on the Sunday morning of 04/07/24
               - We are mediums of sorts, bring to others' ears what Bach has to say!
                  - The "Cum Sancto Spiritu" (`Cum Sancto Spiritu in gloria Dei Patris. Amen.`) is the final section of the Gloria from Bach's Mass in B Minor, BWV 232. It's a magnificent and intricate choral piece, both in terms of music and theological depth. This text, though brief, encapsulates the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, highlighting the unity and co-operation of the Holy Spirit with God the Father, all within the context of divine glory. It's a powerful and concise declaration of faith, expressed through one of Bach's most vigorous and uplifting choral settings. The exuberance and complexity of the music beautifully mirror the profound simplicity of the text, offering a fitting conclusion to the Gloria and showcasing Bach's unmatched ability to convey theological concepts through music.
