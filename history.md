- Double entendre is an instance of a metaphorical deletion which serves several purposes: Original meaning is communicated
- Instead of censorship, given its inappropriateness for some members of the audience, deletive transformation is utilized
- Skillful as well as playful and creates bonds among participants
- This is akin to `freedom within fetters` or even dancing in chains
- `Empowering` is the broader term that brings Chomsky & Foucault into Fellowship: Syntax & Hierarchy intermingle

  - Case of "The Devil Wears Prada" where Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, explains to Andy Sachs, played by Anne Hathaway, the depth and influence of the fashion industry. In this scene, Miranda elucidates the chain of decisions and influences that led to Andy's choice of a blue sweater, detailing how even what Andy considers to be a mundane piece of clothing has been shaped by the high-fashion world. This monologue reflects the hierarchical nature of fashion and Miranda's top-tier position within that hierarchy. It's a critical moment that underscores the power dynamics and complexities of taste, choice, and influence within the fashion industry.
